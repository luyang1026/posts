### Hub, Switch & Router
Hub and Switches are used to exchange data within a local network

Hubs & Switches are used to create network. Routers are used to connect network.

- Hub: data is copyed to **all** other ports
- Switch: data is only directed to the **intended** port
- Router: routes data from one network to another based on their **IP address**
