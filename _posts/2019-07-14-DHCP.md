### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Every computer on a network has to have an I.P. address.

there are two ways that a computer can be assigned an I.P. addresss: ***static IP*** or ***dynamic IP***

- static IP: where a user assigns an I.P. address manually.
- dynamic IP: where a computer gets an I.P. address from a DHCP server

A DHCP server automatically assigns a computer an:
- I.P. adresss
- Subnet mask
- Default gateway
- DNS server

The DHCP server assigns the I.P. address as a lease.

A lease is the amount of time an I.P. address is assigned to a computer.

A reservation ensures that a specific computer or device will always be given the same I.P. address. [image]

DHCP is a service that runs on a server. It also a service that runs on many routers.
